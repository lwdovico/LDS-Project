The only changes to a previous delivery was done on the Part I, we radically sped up the upload of the table by executing 100 query at each iteration. This allowed us to get a total execution time of 2 minutes, instead of the 15 minutes we had to wait before at best.
We also redesigned the uploading part to execute without saving and loading back the tables. 

The only other thing we corrected was a typo in the last part: we casted IsCorrect to a bool without keeping into consideration the possibility of it being a string. There is no issue if the data is the preprocessed one, but if the data is first stored and then loaded again it will be loaded as a string thus returning always true when casting it (in our case "0") to a boolean. We corrected it casting it to a numeric type so that the bool could be correctly evaluated.

# Part I
The python script to run is in the "LDS Project (Part I).py", we also kept the "... - Data Integration Notebook.ipynb" we used to write and test the functions. Some outputs are visible and the order of cells and functions is the one of develepoment, thus it is slightly easier to read than the *.py file.

A short report has been provided to show the schema and summarize the tasks and processes we focused on.

The credentials.txt is a file containing the IP address of the server and the credentials of our group, it was done a security measure to keep the code safe to be shared and uploaded later.

The file must be in the same folder of the script for it to run without problems.
